# C++ Practice Projects

This folder contains beginner-friendly C++ programs to help you learn.

## Programs Included

### 1. hello.cpp
Your first C++ program! Prints "Hello, World!" to the console.

**Compile and run:**
```bash
g++ hello.cpp -o hello
./hello
```

### 2. variables.cpp
Demonstrates different data types in C++ (int, double, char, bool, string).

./calculator
```

## How to Use

1. Open any `.cpp` file in VS Code
2. **Method 1:** Use Code Runner extension (Ctrl+Alt+N)
3. **Method 2:** Open terminal and manually compile:
   ```bash
   g++ filename.cpp -o outputname
   ./outputname
   ```

## Next Steps

After mastering these basics, try:
- Adding more features to the calculator (power, square root)
- Creating a number guessing game
- Building a to-do list manager
- Writing programs with loops and arrays

## Tips for Beginners

- **Always compile before running** - C++ needs to be compiled into an executable
- **Read error messages carefully** - They tell you exactly what's wrong
- **Practice daily** - Even 15 minutes a day helps
- **Experiment** - Try modifying the code and see what happens!
